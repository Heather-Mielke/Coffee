The technologies used in this application include:
+ Node
+ EJS
+ CSS
+ Express
+ Mongoose
+ jQuery
+ passport
+ bcrypt

The approach that was taken, was to start with logging into the sight. Then have it bring you too the main page, which included information about coffee, a user quote, and some standard creations of coffee. I also wanted to add in a feature to be able to look for coffee shops near you within the site. I was unsuccessful with my exact attempt but was at least able to embed a google maps that shows coffee shops in my area and if they click larger map it will bring the user to google maps to search near by locations. I wanted to have the option for users to create their own coffee combinations and have them be stored to be able to try when they go and get coffee next.

Things that I was unable to accomplish but want to go back too is actually having a proper log in. The authentication I was able to create is just stored in an array so it is not a valid log in for a real world application so I would like to figure out how to actually get that accomplished. I would also like to be able to create an actually searchable google maps within my website. I want to look into creating a search bar for the users creations so they can look up created drinks by types, flavors, etc. And finally as I thought about it I would like to have some kind of option on the users creations that would put it as a keeper or a never try again vs just deleting them. That way they can reference which ones they tried but did not like.
